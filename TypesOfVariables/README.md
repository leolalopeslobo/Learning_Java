<h2>Types of Variables</h2>

<h6>There are 2 Types of Variables</h6>
1. **Primitive** Variables
2. **Reference** Variables

Primitives Variables: These are variables of **primitive datatypes**. There are **8** primitive datatypes.
These are **4 used to represent integers: byte, short, int and long**, **2 used to represent floating-point: float and double**, and **char**, **boolean**.
Also primitives are datatypes that can't be broken down into smaller parts.


Reference Variables: These are variables are of **reference types**. These types can be **class, abstract class, interface**.
Eg: String, Student, etc..
FQN of String is **java.lang.String**

Inorder to design a class we need the following:
A class contains data and methods.
Data is Object, it is the state that is defined for an object.
When data changes we have the methods.

<h6>Based on place of decalaration (where they are declared) there are 3 types of variables</h6>
1. Instance / Object / Non-Static variable
2. Static / Class variable
3. Local variable

Instance / Object / Non-Static variable: If you **decalare** a variable **within a class but outside of method or constructor**, these are instance variables.

Static / Class variables: If you **decalare** a variable **within a class but outside of method or constructor and they are defined as static**, these are static variables.
Whenever you find something **common for a whole class** make it as a **static/class** variable.

Local variable: If you **decalare** a variable **within a class but inside of method or constructor**, these are local variables.
