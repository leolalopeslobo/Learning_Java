Upcasting and it's nature

Object-Oriented Programming allows us to decide which method to call at Runtime and not Compile time. It's dynamic and not statically bounded.









Questions
-> Why would want dynamic bounding? -> if you want to call the child object then do so by using the child reference and child object ryt?
-> Why exactly is Downcasting not possible?
