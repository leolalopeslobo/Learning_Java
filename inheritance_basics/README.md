What is Inheritance?
The process of aquiring properties of a class by another class.
---------------

Without the presence of Inheritance, the and language behaves like an Object Based Language(OBL). Some examples are JavaScript, VB, Ada.
---------------

Inheritance provides us with 'Code Reusability' and this is also leads to 'Faster Development'.
---------------

'extends' keyword specifies Inheritance.
extends is used by one class to acquire the properties of another class.
In this way, the called using the extend keyword is the Child class since it inherits the properties of another class and that class is called the Parent class.
---------------

What all can be inherited by Child class from Parent class?
All non-private members from Parent Class can be inherited by Child class
---------------

Properties of Inheritance
1. Child class can define its own members
2. Child class can redefined the behaviour of Parent class methods (Polymorphism - Overriding (dynamic polymorphism))
----------------

Inheritance automatically contains Polymorphism in it in the form of Overriding.
Overriding: This is a mechnism in which the subclass (child class) redefines the behaviours of the super class (parent class) methods.
The signature must be same for overrriding
