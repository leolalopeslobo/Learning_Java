When we have 2 classes <br>
say, <br>
A { <br>
<br>
} <br>
and <br>
B { <br>
<br>
} <br>
<h3>TYPE I: 'Is A' or 'Generalization by Specialization' Relationship</h3> <br>
This type of relationship is **semantic relationship** meaning some kind of logic <br>
Inheritance is an **is a** relationship or **generalization by specialization** relationship <br>
This relationship exists amoung similar components. Eg: Amoung classes <br>
Eg: <br>
1. Employee and TechEmployee 
2. Customer and ClassicClassic Cutomer
These are General and Specialised classes that means that the TechEmployee is a specialized class of the general Employee class.
<br><br><br>


<h3>TYPE II: 'Has A' or 'Association' Relationship</h3> <br>
This type of relationship is **structural relationship** meaning say in a room there is a fan or the laptop and me, this is structural relationship no sematic relationship <br>
This relationship exists amoung similar components. Eg: Amoung classes <br><br>

Association has 2 forms: <br>
1. Aggregation - also known as whole by part (whole/part)
2. Composition - also known as whole by part (whole/part)

Difference between Aggregation and Composition <br>
Aggregation: If the part misses, whole still exists. Eg: The department (part) and university (whole) <br>
Composition: Is the part misses, whole doesn't exist. Eg: The engine (part) and car (whole) <br>
Eg: <br>
Employee and Address (Employee has an address) <br>
    Employee has so many detials and address is a part <br>
Customer and Address ( "" ) <br> 
Department and Teacher (That means that the Department has Teachers) <br>
University and Department (This means that the university has departments) <br>
<br><br><br>

<h3>TYPE III: 'Realization' Relationship</h3> <br>
This relationship exists amoung different components. Eg: Class and Interface or Class and Abstract Class <br>
Abstraction follows realization relationship <br>
