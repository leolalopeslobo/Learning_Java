When we have 2 classes <br>
say, \n
A {

}
and
B {

}
TYPE I: 'Is A' or 'Generalization by Specialization' Relationship
This type of relationship is **semantic relationship** meaning some kind of logic
Inheritance is an **is a** relationship or **generalization by specialization** relationship
This relationship exists amoung similar components. Eg: Amoung classes
Eg: 
1. Employee and TechEmployee
2. Customer and ClassicClassic Cutomer

These are General and Specialised classes that means that the TechEmployee is a specialized class of the general Employee class.



TYPE II: 'Has A' or 'Association' Relationship
This type of relationship is **structural relationship** meaning say in a room there is a fan or the laptop and me, this is structural relationship no sematic relationship
This relationship exists amoung similar components. Eg: Amoung classes

Association has 2 forms:
1. Aggregation - also known as whole by part (whole/part)
2. Composition - also known as whole by part (whole/part)

Difference between Aggregation and Composition
Aggregation: If the part misses, whole still exists. Eg: The department (part) and university (whole)
Composition: Is the part misses, whole doesn't exist. Eg: The engine (part) and car (whole)
Eg:
Employee and Address (Employee has an address)
    Employee has so many detials and address is a part
Customer and Address ( "" )
Department and Teacher (That means that the Department has Teachers)
University and Department (This means that the university has departments)




TYPE III: 'Has A' or 'Realization' Relationship
This relationship exists amoung different components. Eg: Class and Interface or Class and Abstract Class
Abstraction follows realization relationship
